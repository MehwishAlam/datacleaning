# Data Cleaning on KPMG Customer Dataset

I have recently started KPMG Internship . The first tasks is to analyze the major problem and the quality of the dataset have received from the firm. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organization. They needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy. 

The dataset received from the firm were:

* Customer Demographic
* Customer Address
* Transaction Data 

One of the problems with dataset is the null values, also there were consistency issue in the provided dataset. The dataset also have some column which don't contain validate values and is not helpful in evaluating the model. The data also have issues like standardize values for entries(e.g. using of F, female or Female for the same entry). I try to remove these issues. Below are my attempts for the problems. 

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!
